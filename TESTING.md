# Spector Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test Spector on real Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses using Developer Mode. (The web/PWA player is fully usable today for phone rehearsal — no signup required. This doc focuses on real hardware validation for beta testers.)

---

## 1. Enable Developer Mode on Your Glasses

1. Open the **Meta AI app** on your phone.
2. Go to your profile → tap the **Meta AI app version number** at the bottom **5 times**.
3. A hidden toggle called **Developer Mode** will appear. Turn it **on**.

---

## 2. Open Spector on Your Glasses

1. Make sure your Ray-Ban Meta glasses are connected and awake.
2. On your phone, open the **Meta AI app**.
3. Go to **Settings → App connections → Add a Web App**.
4. Paste this URL:

   **https://www.spectorlabs.io**

5. Spector should open directly on your glasses.

## 3. How to Use Spector

- Paste or upload your script on the landing page.
- Tap **"Launch Teleprompter"**.
- **Comfort mode**: Subtle breathing + gentle spatial movement when you move your head. Feels more natural and calm. On Display glasses, the right-temple button/touch controls (and future Neural Band gestures) can advance or pause the script where supported by the platform.
- **Focus mode**: Completely static. No breathing, no movement. Best for when you want maximum stability.
- **Non-Display models (Gen 1/2)**: Use as phone companion rehearsal tool with haptics and audio. Glasses provide camera/AI.
- **Display / HUD models**: Run directly on the glasses lens for heads-up teleprompting.
- **Other smart glasses** (XREAL, Viture, Brilliant Labs, etc.): Works via PWA on phone companion or browser-supported devices. Controls depend on the hardware (touch, voice, external controller).
- Tap the screen or press play to start/stop.
- Use the speed presets (Slow / Normal / Fast) to match your speaking pace.
- Tap anywhere to show/hide controls.
- **Test the right-temple button flow**: Open the player with **`app.html?debug`** to show the tester scaffolding (button simulator, tilt sliders, hardware legend — hidden for regular users), then use the "Simulate right temple button (advance)" button or press 'b' (the key works even without ?debug). This mimics the physical button on Ray-Ban Meta for advancing chunks.
- When finished, you’ll see a clean end screen with stats (chunks read + total time).

## Hardware Testing Focus (especially for beta testers)

Please test and report on:
- **Right-temple physical button** on Ray-Ban Meta: Single press to advance? Double-tap pause? Does it feel natural while speaking?
- **HUD readability & Comfort**: How does the text size/leading look in the actual lens? Does the spatial breathing help presence or cause distraction?
- **Comparison**: How does Spector feel vs Meta's built-in teleprompter?
- **Simulator utility**: The on-screen "Simulate right temple button" + 'b' key in the player — useful for desktop practice?

Sign up at https://www.spectorlabs.io (Hardware beta section) and mention your exact hardware. Source code: https://github.com/hydrogenbondss/SPECTOR. We'll send a short structured feedback form.

## 4. Known Limitations (Early Version)

- Spatial movement works best with moderate head movement.
- Very long scripts may feel slower.
- Haptics only work if your device supports vibration.
- This is still a web-based experience.

## 5. Feedback

If you're testing Spector, feedback on these areas would be very helpful:
- How natural does Comfort mode feel compared to Focus mode?
- On Ray-Ban Meta Display: Does the right temple button / touchpad work well for advancing the script or pausing? Any issues with gesture mapping?
- Is the head movement sensitivity in Comfort comfortable on glasses vs phone?
- How does the HUD text readability compare for different script lengths / chunk sizes?
- Would you use this for real speeches or presentations? How does it compare to Meta's built-in teleprompter?
- For non-Ray-Ban glasses (XREAL, Viture etc.): What controls work best for you?
